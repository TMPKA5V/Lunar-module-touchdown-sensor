## The touch down sensors of the lunar module of the early Apollo missions

![](/Images/1.jpg)

A very simple mechanism but very crucial because the engines had to be turned off immediately after touchdown, not earlier not later or probably the LEM and the men would have gone.
So I run some search on Google for Lunar Module Apollo and keywords along this line and landed (!) on the [Apollo Lunar Module Documentation page](http://history.nasa.gov/alsj/alsj-LMdocs.html) at [NASA History Division](http://history.nasa.gov/). I downloaded the [Apollo Operations Handbook Lunar Module part I](http://history.nasa.gov/alsj/LM10HandbookVol1.pdf). It’s a huge document, but after all it’s the handook of the Lunar Module. It could be larger, though.
I of course looked for the part related to the Lunar Contact Lights and the logic behind them : of course it could not be one switch and one lamp only.
Lunar Contact Lights (paragraph 2.10.2.2.2) reads “Both LUNAR CONTACT lights (panels 1 and 3) go on when one or more of the three lunar surface sensing probes contacts the lunar surface. When on, the lights advise the crew to shut off the descent engine.“….Makes sense.
The paragraph contains the electrical (principle) drawing of the circuit : a number of relays relay the contacts at Eagle’s probes and a few basic techniques are used to reduce the risks of false signalling or no signalling.
The circuit is this one (part II is available also at the NASA Technical Reports Server as Unclassified; No Copyright; Unlimited; Publicly available : I assume that the same applies to part I.
